## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Video Doesn't Get Views

**Mitigation:**
- Optimize title/thumbnail (A/B test)
- Share on Reddit, HN, Twitter
- Embed in README and docs
- Consider paid promotion ($20 Google Ads)

### Risk 2: Low Discord Engagement

**Mitigation:**
- Seed with interesting questions
- Highlight in every piece of content
- Offer perks (direct support, swag)
- Regular office hours

### Risk 3: Can't Find Case Study Subjects

**Mitigation:**
- Reach out to existing users proactively
- Offer free performance audit
- Use smaller apps (100+ users OK)
- Create fictional case study with real data

### Risk 4: Social Media Post Flops

**Mitigation:**
- Engage authentically (not promotional)
- Share useful information (not just links)
- Time posts for max visibility (weekday mornings)
- Learn from what works, iterate

---
