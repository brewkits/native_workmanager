## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Content Engagement

**Symptom:** Video views <1K, article reads <100
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test headlines and thumbnails
- Survey audience for content preferences
- Collaborate with Flutter influencers
- Improve SEO (keyword research)

### Risk 2: Slow Community Growth

**Symptom:** Discord <20 members after Month 2
**Mitigation:**
- Launch early adopter perks (direct support, swag)
- Increase presence in Flutter communities
- Host virtual meetups or hackathons
- Gamify contributions (badges, leaderboard)

### Risk 3: flutter_workmanager Responds

**Symptom:** They add native workers or task chains
**Mitigation:**
- We have 6-12 month head start
- Keep innovating (v1.1, v1.2 features)
- Build community loyalty (switching cost)
- Emphasize KMP architecture (future-proof)

### Risk 4: Limited Production Adoption

**Symptom:** <10 production apps after Month 4
**Mitigation:**
- Offer free performance audits
- White-glove migration support
- Publish more case studies (even small apps)
- Address adoption barriers (see ADOPTION_BARRIERS.md)

---

## Next Steps After 6 Months

**If Successful (50+ production apps):**
- Launch v2.0 with Desktop support
- Expand to Web (WebWorkers)
- Enterprise support offerings
- Conference speaking tour

**If Moderate Success (20-49 production apps):**
- Continue content marketing
- Deepen community engagement
- Address remaining adoption barriers
- Focus on retention and advocacy

**If Below Target (<20 production apps):**
- Survey users for honest feedback
- Reassess positioning and messaging
- Consider pivots or feature additions
